<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Heyo, my name's Beatsleigher (Beat-slayer).
I'm a 16-year old developer and comuter enthusiast.
I was born in Germany and lived in England for a few years and I can communicate fluently in both
languages.
I started coding as I was eleven or twelve, but only to show off. Not really to create things for the wider mass. It was more or less a "Hey, look what I can do what you can't do!" thing of mine.
But then last year it kinda got serious. I started my first project, Beatsleigher's Root Helper.
I was more advanced in Batch than I was in Visual Basic, so all I used VB for, was the UI. The rest was handled by batch-scripts which I had converted to .exe files, so no-one could see the messy code I created, I wasn't familiar with any open source licenses.
So that project just flopped. It became exactly the opposite of what I expected. But that was a lesson I had to learn, I guess.
A few months after, I had gathered all my might and got over the embarrassment that my first-ever project had failed and I started anew. Universal Android Toolkit, or Beatsleigher &amp; M4gkman's Universal Android Toolkit as it was called back then was born. I am still working on getting it out of beta, but it's pretty hard.
After months and months of coding I grew tired of it and decided to put Universal Android Toolkit aside and worked on a smaller project for a few days. It turned out great!
It got mentioned on the XDA portal and got a few thousand downloads. I felt great and that feeling encouraged me to continue with Universal Android Toolkit so I coded and coded and coded and finally started a small team of my own, Team M4gkBeatz.
With my new team, development went way faster and I could focus on DetectCPU again.
In the mean time I had gotten a few requests to port DetectCPU into a different language, which was merely impossible because the way the program got its data, via WMI.
And then, a few days ago (The 6th of October '13) I got fed up and decided to create a lib which gets exactly that data so one could use the same information in several ways and in multiple languages. Thus, SysLib was born. I hope that my little lib will once become as great as CPU-Z and more.</p>
