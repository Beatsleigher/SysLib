{"name":"Syslib","tagline":"A lib created by Beatsleigher to easily query for WMI data","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nWelcome to Syslib!\r\nHere you can find downloads, sources, Q&As and more!\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nHeyo, my name's Beatsleigher (Beat-slayer).\r\nI'm a 16-year old developer and comuter enthusiast.\r\nI was born in Germany and lived in England for a few years and I can communicate fluently in both\r\nlanguages.\r\nI started coding as I was eleven or twelve, but only to show off. Not really to create things for the wider mass. It was more or less a \"Hey, look what I can do what you can't do!\" thing of mine.\r\nBut then last year it kinda got serious. I started my first project, Beatsleigher's Root Helper.\r\nI was more advanced in Batch than I was in Visual Basic, so all I used VB for, was the UI. The rest was handled by batch-scripts which I had converted to .exe files, so no-one could see the messy code I created, I wasn't familiar with any open source licenses.\r\nSo that project just flopped. It became exactly the opposite of what I expected. But that was a lesson I had to learn, I guess.\r\nA few months after, I had gathered all my might and got over the embarrassment that my first-ever project had failed and I started anew. Universal Android Toolkit, or Beatsleigher & M4gkman's Universal Android Toolkit as it was called back then was born. I am still working on getting it out of beta, but it's pretty hard.\r\nAfter months and months of coding I grew tired of it and decided to put Universal Android Toolkit aside and worked on a smaller project for a few days. It turned out great!\r\nIt got mentioned on the XDA portal and got a few thousand downloads. I felt great and that feeling encouraged me to continue with Universal Android Toolkit so I coded and coded and coded and finally started a small team of my own, Team M4gkBeatz.\r\nWith my new team, development went way faster and I could focus on DetectCPU again.\r\nIn the mean time I had gotten a few requests to port DetectCPU into a different language, which was merely impossible because the way the program got its data, via WMI.\r\nAnd then, a few days ago (The 6th of October '13) I got fed up and decided to create a lib which gets exactly that data so one could use the same information in several ways and in multiple languages. Thus, SysLib was born. I hope that my little lib will once become as great as CPU-Z and more.\r\n\r\n### About\r\n\r\nSysLib is a .Net library (.dll) which queries for WMI information and allows easy access to system tools from any .Net language. (.Net languages include: Visual Basic.Net, C#, Visual C++, F#, etc, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor:\r\n@Beatsleigher\r\n\r\nContributors:\r\n@Beatsleigher\r\n\r\n### Have fun!\r\n\r\nHave fun expreimenting with SysLib and please don't forget to at least link up the GitHub link in your project/s if you use SysLib!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
